# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
- The purpose of this analysis is to provide outcomes based on Launch Date and based on Goal, as well as recommendations to end user.
## Analysis and Challenges
- On this analysis we ahve used the data set provided originally on files StarterBook.xlsx
- The data set was then used to create two analysis as follows: ***Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date*** and ***Outcomes vs Goals***
- On the above, we have created a PIVOT table to summarize the outcomes for each month, filtered by patent category.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- Close to 59% of the Outcomes were succeful, been 50% above the average, which hold value very similar to its median.
- It fair to recommend that campaings that are launched between the months of April and August have a higher successful rate.
- Likewise, campiangs that are launched between November and March have the lowest sucessful rate.
- The most unlikely month to successfull campains is the month of October. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![](https://github.com/fgoulartsalomao/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
- Based on the analysis perfomed for the ***Outcomes Based on Goal*** we can conclude that the highest successul rates are found between projects **wihtin Less than 1000** and **">1000 to <=4999"** with success rates above 60%
- On the oposite direction, projects with budget from 10,000 and above should be avoied and the percentage of failures is lower than successes.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- The main challenge was to apply the given rules to the table in excel. The process of manually selecting and changing the rules were cumbersome.
-The second personal challenge was that I forgot that the = on the between values parameter, making my chart summary not match as the sum and percentiles wouldn't be the same.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- *Campiangs that are launched between November and March have the lowest sucessful rate.*
- *The most unlikely month to successfull campains is the month of October.*
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- *Based on the analysis perfomed for the ***Outcomes Based on Goal*** we can conclude that the highest successul rates are found between projects **wihtin Less than 1000** and **">1000 to <=4999"** with success rates above 60%*
- *Projects with budget from 10,000 and above should be avoied and the percentage of failures is lower than successes.*
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- The columns I and J
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Line chart showing the campaing with goals and the pleged, been they under below, at budget and over budget level.
